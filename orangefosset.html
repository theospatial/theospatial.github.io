                <h2>Vision</h2>
                <p>OrangeFosset is building world where access to essential hygiene services accessible to all, enabled by repurposing high-performance computing heat-waste to provide warm showers at a low, zero, or negative price. We envision bosltering communities where even the most vulnerable members have access to clean water and hygiene facilities, integration of bitcoin mining and water heating systems, contributing to public health, dignity, and the transition to a more sustainable and inclusive economy.</p>
                
                <h2>How OrangeFosset Works</h2>

                <caption>Empowering Communities, One Shower at a Time.</caption>

                <h4>Energy Inception and Utilization</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Bitcoin Mining for Heat Generation</strong>: The process begins with bitcoin mining operations, where computers equipped with specialized ASIC chips contribute their calculations to secure the bitcoin network and compete to confirm blocks of base level transactions. This activity consumes electrical energy - of which OrangeFosset is incentivised to source from predominantly renewable low-cost power - and converts it into computational power and, subsequently, heat.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Heat Recovery and Transformation</strong>: The heat generated by the mining equipment, a byproduct often considered waste in traditional setups, is ingeniously captured using hydro-cooling systems. The system is designed to efficiently transfer thermal energy from the mining hardware to water reservoir, raising its temperature without additional energy costs.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Water Heating and Distribution</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Heating Water for Community Use</strong>: The heated water is then directed towards a co-located public shower facility, both of which are housed in a modified shipping container. This facility provides hot showers to users, leveraging the thermal energy recovered from bitcoin mining operations. The water temperature is regulated to ensure it meets safety and comfort standards for users.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Dynamic Energy and Cost Management</strong>: OrangeFosset's operational model is designed to optimize energy use and costs. During periods of peak energy generation and low demand, the system can offer showers at lower costs, zero cost, or even at negative pricing, incentivizing usage when it's most energy-efficient and economically feasible. This is made possible by OrangeFossets relationships with energy providers through methods such as power purchase agreements \(PPA\), and time of use \(TOU\) planning and settled using the bitcoin second layer lightning network. Second-order effects of this practice is that OrangeFosset acts as a buyer of first resort for otherwise wasted energy - a result of lack of market demand and intermittencies in overbuilt renewable sources.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Community Engagement and Accessibility</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Accessible Hygiene Services</strong>: By providing low-cost, zero-cost, or negatively priced showers, OrangeFosset addresses the critical need for hygiene services in underserved communities, including unhoused persons. This initiative not only improves public health but also supports social inclusion and dignity.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Economic and Environmental Benefits</strong>: The system promotes environmental sustainability by maximizing the use of renewable energy and minimizing waste. It also offers an economic model that supports the viability of bitcoin mining operations through enhanced energy efficiency and new revenue streams from the provision of showers and incentivising use during off-peak energy conditions.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Technological Integration</strong>: OrangeFosset incorporates advanced controls for temperature and mining operation management, a potential bitcoin lightning POS system for seamless transactions, and plans for a maintenance bounty program. These features ensure the facility's efficient operation, user accessibility, and system sustainability.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>OrangeFosset stands at the crossroads of technology, sustainability, and community service. </p>
                
                <p>OrangeFosset's unique system interlinks Bitcoin mining operations with a sophisticated water heating mechanism. 
                  <strong>This dual-functionality not only maximizes energy efficiency but also turns the singular waste byproduct - heat - into a valuable resource.</strong> 
                  By reimagining the potential of bitcoin mining's heat byproduct, it offers a practical solution to pressing social needs while paving the way for a more sustainable and inclusive future.</p>
