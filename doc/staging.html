      <p>As a graduate in Spatial Data Science and Technology from the University of Oregon, I am looking to work as a GIS technician or developer for a local government agency or tech company, where I can contribute my technical, analytical, visualization,
        and communication skills to work towards data-driven policy change and develop location-aware products which bring benefit to my community.</br>
        </br>
        I take great interest in how our cities and interactions will change as we enter a fourth technological revolution. Multiple technologies will continue to fundamentally alter how we live, work, and socialize and more are on the cusp of entering the mainstream.
        Machine learning and autonomous robotics are increasing in use, while billions of IoT enabled devices are coming online. Nascent platforms like augmented reality and quantum computing show great promise in helping us find new ways to solve problems,
        with increasing velocity and more naturally than ever before. I am excited to work where I can help cities and businesses navigate through this transformative time by making sense of the abundance of data available for decision making. </section>

        </p>
        <p>During my time working for the City of Eugene - Green Infrastructure, I provided GIS services for the Urban Forestry staff and interns working on the <a href="https://www.eugene-or.gov/3678/Street-Tree-Interactive-Map">Street Tree Inventory</a>,
          an endeavor which The City had been working on for over a decade. Field crews would catalog trees in the public right-of-way using an ArcGIS Collector app developed by the Parks and Open Space GIS staff. At the end of the contract, each neighborhood
          in the city had an initial canvassing and a dataset of over 60,000 right-of-way trees were described.</br>
          </br>
          As neighborhoods were marked off and an updated dataset was made available for offline analysis, I queried the dataset and separated the data by neighborhood so that other staff could analyze the data to determine statistics such as estimated site value,
          carbon sequestration, and species distribution. This included creating tools for use in ArcMap and scripts to chain analyses and iterate through multiple folders. </br>
          </br>
          In addition to preparing data for Urban Forestry staff I processed, visualized, and performed preliminary analysis on Urban Heat Island data gathered by the Sustaining Urban Places Research (SUPR) Lab at Portland State University. The data had been held
          on a local drive for some months, so I offered to forward it to the division's GIS department so that it could be integrated into The City;s server for access across all divisions. This included preprocessing and performing map algebra on a
          raster dataset of over 12GB, including unit conversion, change detection, and zonal statistics. By overlaying UHI data, impervious surface layers, and the street tree inventory dataset, a relationship between hard and green infrastructure could
          be viewed.</p>

        <p><a href="https://illumicloudjs.appspot.com/">illumicloudjs</a> for Firefox 60.x is a JavaScript web application prototype for the purpose of improving spatial and temporal resolution of lighting condition data. Data recorded within the app can
          be interpolated to create an illuminance surface raster. The data could find use in well-lit path analysis and other applications including solar panel placement, ecological footprint or canopy cover estimation. </br>
          </br>
          The user opens the app (by navigating to the site), and taps "Allow Location". From there, the user can click "Record" to begin logging points at a pre-determined interval. At each tick, the time, location and ambient light sensor reading (measured in
          lux) is attached to an id and a point is generated. As the user walks, their path is charted and illuminance levels for the duration are collected. When finished, the user can export the data points to a comma-separated-values file (.csv). </br>
          </br>
          As multiple routes are collected, they can be fed to an Arcpy script which aggregates the points into a point cloud shapefile for use in GIS software. By interpolating the points, you can generate rasters which hold illuminance data to inform nighttime
          lighting conditions or daytime shading.</p>

        <h3 class="emphasize">2021 for 2021</h3>
        <p>This ArcGIS Online Story Map is an educational pamphlet for the citizens of Eugene to encourage participation in a tree planting initiative beginning in 2018. As part of a course taken in the UO College of Design, my team members and I worked
          with Scott Altenhoff with City of Eugene Urban Forestry to educate and encourage community members to volunteer a planting site for one of 2021 Giant Sequoia the city plans to place throughout the city to offset the carbon emissions expected
          from the 2021 World Track and Field Championships.</br>
          </br>
          Using the Cascade Story template and two embedded story maps - <em>Right Tree, Right Place</em> using the Journal template, and <em>Your Tree, Your Place</em> using Crowdsource (Beta), we delivered a product which informed the reader of the
          environmental, economic, and social benefits of planting Giant Sequoia while conferring The City's commitment to "Right Tree, Right Place" when choosing a planting site. Additionally, the story map ended with a call to action, where the reader
          was able to upload a picture of their potential site, along with its geolocation, to serve as the framework for tracking planting sites for use in the city's street tree inventory.</br>
          </br>
          Though only pieces of this presentation <a href="https://www.eugene-or.gov/3794/2021-for-2021">were used by the City of Eugene</a>, I was given the opportunity to assist in the implementation of the data collection feature I envisioned withing
          this project. I designed and communicated the data requirements for the web form that The City's IT department developed for public submission of planting sites. The form is housed as an entry in the <a href="https://www.eugene-or.gov/1776/Maintenance-Service-Request">Public Works Service Request site</a>.</p>
